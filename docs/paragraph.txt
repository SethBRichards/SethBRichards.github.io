<p>Hello, I’m Seth! I was born and lived in Portland, Oregon until I was 16, and then my family moved to Lahaina, Hawaii. I currently live in Seattle, Washington, where I’m a senior pursuing my BS in Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington.</p>

<p>When I moved to Hawaii, I joined my new high school’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lunas3882/?hl=en">FRC Robotics team</a>, which exposed me to programming and circuitry for the first time. I was absolutely enthralled at first sight, leading me to take some Engineering design classes that taught me CAD, and gave me some hands-on experience with Arduino projects. A couple years later, I made up my mind and decided that Electrical Engineering was the best way for me to chase after my passions.</p>

<p>When I got to college, I joined the <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/aorsborn/index.html">Orsborn Lab</a>, an ECE affiliated research lab at the university, where I currently volunteer. In the lab, I’m using MATLAB and Python to translate some legacy code for signal processing. I’m learning a lot about data analytics, which will be used to Brain-Computer Interface technologies. It’s cool stuff, and it’s helping me learn a lot about coding, academia, and teamwork.</p>

<p>My current plan is to focus my EE degree in the concentration my school refers to as“<a href="https://vannevar.ece.uw.edu/academics/undergrad/MajorConcentrationAreas.html#PowerElectronics">Power Electronics and Drives</a>”. I'm very passionate about renewable energies, power, and controls, so this concentration allows me to get a good mix of each. I think power electronics and renewables are absolutely criticial in reducing the effects of climate change, so I want my career to focus on those to help make my community and the world a better place.

<p>Outside of school and work, I like to read science fiction, play racquetball, go hiking, and keep up to date on global affairs. I used to be a competitive fencer; ask me about it if you’re interested!</p>
